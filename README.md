# Chest X-Ray Classification
This repository proposes a workflow for training and evaluating deep learning models designed to classify chest X-ray images using PyTorch.

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to develop a system capable of accurately classifying chest X-ray images into different categories, such as pleural effusion, pneumonia, cardiomegaly, or other abnormalities. 

## Information about the Dataset
The models used for classification have been trained using [PadChest Datataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07441)</br>
